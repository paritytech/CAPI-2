# Polkadot API CLI

## Getting Started

Add a chain by using the add command

```sh
polkadot-api add ksm -n ksmcc3 -p
```

In this example, `ksm` is the key to be used to reference this chain, `-n ksmcc3` is to source from the "well-known chain" Kusama, and `-p` is to persist the metadata into a file so that it doesn't need to be re-fetched.

Then you can run the CLI without arguments to generate the descriptor files

```sh
polkadot-api
```

Files are generated by default into the `src/codegen` folder, but this can be customized on the `polkadot-api add` step. See the reference below for more information.

## General Usage

```sh
polkadot-api --help
```

```sh
Usage: polkadot-api [options] [command]

Polkadot API CLI

Options:
  -h, --help                  display help for command

Commands:
  generate [options]          Generate file descriptors
  add [options] <key> [dest]  Add a new chain spec to the list
  update [options] [keys]     Update the metadata files
  remove [options] <key>      Remove a chain spec to the list
  help [command]              display help for command
```

## Configuration file

By default, the Polkadot API configuration file is `polkadot-api.json`, located at the project's root folder. This file contains a record of the added chains, their sources, and the destination folders for each one of them.

All the arguments of the CLI accept an option `--config {file}` to use a different configuration file.

Optionally you can have this configuration in the `package.json` file, which will be added under the `polkadot-api` subpath.

## Commands

### Generate

```sh
Usage: polkadot-api generate [options]

Generate descriptor files

Options:
  --config <filename>    Source for the config file
  -k, --key <key>        Key of the descriptor to generate
  -h, --help             display help for command
```

By default, it generates the descriptor files for all of the chains defined in the config file. To generate only the ones for a specific chain, use the `-k, --key` parameter.

### Add

```sh
Usage: polkadot-api add [options] <key> [dest]

Add a new chain spec to the list

Arguments:
  key                         Key identifier for the chain spec
  dest                        Destination folder for the generated code. Defaults to src/codegen

Options:
  --config <filename>         Source for the config file
  -f, --file <filename>       Source from metadata encoded file
  -w, --wsUrl <URL>           Source from websocket url
  -c, --chainSpec <filename>  Source from chain spec file
  -n, --name <name>           Source from a well-known chain (choices: "polkadot", "ksmcc3", "rococo_v2_2", "westend2")
  -p, --persist               Persist the metadata into the file {name}.scale
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```
