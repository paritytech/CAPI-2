# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- Remove discriminant utilities (`is`, `as`) from `Enum`s. They have been moved to the `Enum(type, value)` function:
  - `myEnum.is('V2')` becomes `Enum.is(myEnum, 'V2')`
  - `myEnum.as('V2')` becomes `Enum.as(myEnum, 'V2')`
- The generic for `Enum<T>` is now an object of `{ [type: string]: any }`, rather than a union of `{ type: string, value: any } | ...Â | { type: string, value: any }`
