# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- The `client` now exposes a `_request` method, which is meant as an "escape hatch"
  to allow the consumers of the JSON-RPC provider have access to debugging endpoints
  such as `system_version`, and other useful endpoints that are not spec compliant.
- Suppot for "optimistic" transactions via the `at` option when creating/broadcasting
  transactions. This makes it possible to create transactions against blocks that are
  not yet finalized. [#486](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/486)
- Allow users to manually pass the `nonce` when creating a transaction. [#498](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/498)

### Fixed

- `substrate-client`: improve the cancelation logic on operations that have not yet received its operationId [#484](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/484)
- `observable-client`: ensure `bestBlocks$` always start with latest known `finalizedBlock` [#491](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/491)
- Stop-recovery: blocks from previous session getting unpinned
- `observable-client`: `operationLimit`-recovery: properly recover from `operationLimit` responses [#494](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/494)
  Closes [#492](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/issues/492)

## 0.6.0 - 2024-05-03

### Breaking

- `client`: rename `watchBlockBlody` to `watchBlockBody`
- `getEstimatedFee` takes as input the sender's address and optionally the "hinted-sign-extensions"
- `tx`: now transactions are mortal by default with a 64 blocks period
- `codegen`: [deduplicate equivalent known types](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api/pull/448)
- Move the `is` and `as` methods from enum values to `Enum`: `Enum.is(value, tag)`, `Enum.as(value, tag)`.

### Changed

- performance optimization: avoid creating a storage operation on `System.Number` storage entry.

### Fixed

- properly export `FixedSizeBinary` (only the type was being exported).
- json-rpc-proxy: Ensure that the proxy works with all the known versions of the JSON-RPC spec
- `cli/codegen`: `Anonymize` is now able to properly distinguish `Binary` types,
  which were previously being anonymized as`FixedSizeBinary<number>`
- `getEstimatedFee` now uses the more comon runtime-call: `TransactionPaymentApi_query_info`
- `pjs-signer`: Ensure blockNumber in SignerPayloadJSON

## 0.5.0 - 2024-04-25

### Breaking

- The generic for `Enum<T>` is now an object of `{ [type: string]: any }`, rather than a union of `{ type: string, value: any } | ...Â | { type: string, value: any }`

### Added

- `getChainSpecData: () => Promise<{name: string, genesisHash: string, properties: any}>`.
- New type `EnumVariant<T, K>` to select one specific variant from an enum.
- Improved Enum type inference so that they can be assigned between types as long as they are compatible.
