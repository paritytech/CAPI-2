## 2024-02-01 - Announcement: Transfer of Ownership

As of 2024-02-01, the original owner and maintainer of the Polkadot-API project, [Parity Technologies], has officially transferred ownership of the project to me, [Josep M Sobrepere].

I want to thank [Parity Technologies] for their past involvement and support for the Polkadot-API project and to give me and the FOSS community the chance of taking the future of Polkdot-API into our own hands.
